Simple controls:
aim with cardboard movement, tap to shoot in the center of the screen.
the game is in endless loop, after loosing all HP the scene will restart.
Player is facing 3 opponents immediately ( debug purpose) after a while auto generated opponents will appear too,It might take a while for them to come from far generated spawn points.

The .apk file is available to download too.

assets:
animations and models are free assets from unity store, not for comercial use.
All sounds are from my personal assets purchases, and can not be used comercially by any 3rd party.

commentary:

The game still needs a lot of polish, the delivered state is what I could do in 48h, I have not enough time to tweak the UI and game balance, as well as cleaning the code as there are many commented parts in code, and it is not properly divided into namespaces.
Thanks,
